/- # Last Lecture -/

/-
We went over the quantifiers `∀` (for all) and `∃` (exists), and the connectives
`∧` (and), `∨` (or), `→` (implies), `↔` (if and only if).
For each of these we saw how to prove them, and how to use an assumption that states this.

/- # Today: Logic (continued) and sets

We cover sections 3.3, 3.6 and 4.1 from Mathematics in Lean. -/

/-
We will discuss negation `¬` (not), classical logic, sequences and sets.
-/


/- ## Negation

The negation `¬ A` just means `A → False`, where `False` is a specific false statement.
We can use the same tactics as for implication:
`intro` to prove a negation, and `apply` to use one. -/

example {p : Prop} (h : p) : ¬ ¬ p := by
  intro h2
  exact h2 h


example {α : Type*} {p : α → Prop} : ¬ (∃ x, p x) ↔ ∀ x, ¬ p x := by
  constructor
  · intro h x hx
    apply h
    use x
    -- or exact ⟨ x, hx ⟩
  · intro h h2
    obtain ⟨ x, hx ⟩ := h2
    specialize h x hx
    exact h

/- We can use `exfalso` to use the fact that everything follows from `False`:
ex falso quod libet -/
example {p : Prop} (h : ¬ p) : p → 0 = 1 := by
  intro h2
  specialize h h2
  exfalso
  assumption


/- `contradiction` proves any goal when two hypotheses are contradictory. -/

example {p : Prop} (h : ¬ p) : p → 0 = 1 := by
  intro h2
  contradiction






/-
We can use classical reasoning (with the law of the excluded middle) using the following tactics.

* `by_contra h` start a proof by contradiction.
* `by_cases h : p` to start a proof by cases on statement `p`.
* `push_neg` to push negations inside quantifiers and connectives.
-/

example {p : Prop} (h : ¬ ¬ p) : p := by
{
  by_contra g
  exact h g
}

example (p q : Prop) (h : ¬ q → ¬ p) : p → q := by
{
  intro hp
  by_contra hnq
  exact h hnq hp
}

example (p q r : Prop) (h1 : p → r) (h2 : ¬ p → r) : r := by
{
  by_cases hp :p
  · exact h1 hp
  · exact h2 hp
}

example {α : Type*} {p : α → Prop} : ¬ (∃ x, p x) ↔ ∀ x, ¬ p x := by
{
  push_neg
  rfl
}

/- # Sets

In set theory you can make sets with arbitrary elements.
In Lean, all sets have to be sets of elements from a specific type.
-/

#check Set ℕ
#check Set ℝ

variable {α β ι : Type*} (x : α) (s t u : Set α)

#check x ∈ s       -- \in or \mem
#check x ∉ s       -- \notin
#check s ⊆ t       -- \sub
#check s ⊂ t       -- \ssub


#check s ∩ t       -- \inter or \cap
#check s ∪ t       -- \union or \cup
#check s \ t       -- it is the normal symbol `\` on your keyboard,
                   -- but you have to write `\\` or `\ ` to enter it
#check sᶜ          -- \compl or \^c
#check (∅ : Set α) -- \empty
#check (Set.univ : Set α)

open Set

#check (univ : Set α)






/- Showing that `x` is an elements of `s ∩ t`, `s ∪ t` or `sᶜ`
corresponds by definition to conjunction, disjunction or negation. -/

#check mem_inter_iff
#check mem_union
#check mem_compl_iff

/- There are various ways to prove this:
* use lemma `mem_inter_iff`
* use `simp`
* directly apply `constructor`
* give a direct proof: `⟨xs, xt⟩`
-/
example (hxs : x ∈ s) (hxt : x ∈ t) : x ∈ s ∩ t := by sorry


example (hxs : x ∈ s) : x ∈ s ∪ t := by sorry









/- `s ⊆ t` means that for every element `x` in `s`, `x` is also an element in `t`. -/

#check subset_def

example : s ∩ t ⊆ s ∩ (t ∪ u) := by sorry

/- you can also prove it at thge level of sets, without talking about elements. -/
example : s ∩ t ⊆ s ∩ (t ∪ u) := by sorry





/- ## Proving two Sets are equal

You can prove that two sets are equal by applying `subset_antisymm` or using the `ext` tactic.
-/
#check (subset_antisymm : s ⊆ t → t ⊆ s → s = t)

example : s ∩ t = t ∩ s := by sorry

# Other operations on sets
-/

/- We can take power sets of sets. -/
example (s : Set α) : 𝒫 s = {t | t ⊆ s} := by rfl -- \powerset







/- We can take unions and intersections of families of sets in three different ways:
* Given a family of sets `C : ι → Set α`
  we can take the union and intersection of `C i`
  as `i` ranges over all elements of `ι`.
-/
example (C : ι → Set α) : ⋃ i : ι, C i = {x : α | ∃ i : ι, x ∈ C i} := by ext; simp

  we can take the union and intersection of `C i`
  as `i` ranges over all elements in `s`.

/-
* Given a collection of sets `C : Set (Set α)`
  we can take the union and intersection of `c`
  for all `c ∈ C`

/- We can take images and preimages of sets.

`f ⁻¹' s` is the preimage of `s` under `f`.
`f '' s` is the image of `s` under `f`. -/
